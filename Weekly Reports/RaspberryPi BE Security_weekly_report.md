## Weekly Report 02/01

### Goals from last week

**Exact copy of the third section from last week (goals from a week ago)**

N/A


#### What did we do last week

**This second subsection should report on progress and issues:**
**...what did we actually do...what worked...what did we learn...what did we have trouble with...where did we get stuck...did we solve the issue...if so how...**

Researching AES encryption and different security protocols that we can use in the project.


### What will we do this week

**Outline your plans and goals for the following week**
**Use bullet points. If tasks from last week aren't complete, roll them over into tasks for the next week with an updated time estimate for time to completion**

- All members:
	- Figure out what to do with an AES encryption key so that it's not exposed to everyone or hardcoded.
	- Test different encryption hashes (MD5, SHA1, ShA256) on the raspberry pi and compare the times.
- Lasha Kaliashvili:
	- Same as 'All members'
- Mikheil Uglava:
	- Same as 'All members'

## Progress and Issues
- Finished testing hashing algorithms, results are ready for the team, and team can discuss and decide what to use.
- Researching on AES encryption is done, security team has implemented features to use environment variables for safe encryption key operations.

## What we will do this week

- No plans yet, the team will be assigned tasks on Thursday, Feb 8.
